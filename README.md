# GiniSpectralFourier

The files in this repo showcase some of the work I did in an interesting research project whilst at UIC -- the 3 datasets that I used in this set are freely available (but just a bit too large to include in a lightweight Git Repo) and are available from the following links: 


1. Stocks Data- https://fmpcloud.io (can extend analysis to date range of your choice)  

2. Amazon Reviews Data- https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html#subsets

3. Crypto Data- https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting


I also put together a few helper functions that complete the base analysis if you provide the correct kinds of input (listed in file & in notebooks) in the `GSFU.py` file. 

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me- https://ckgresla.github.io/contact/
